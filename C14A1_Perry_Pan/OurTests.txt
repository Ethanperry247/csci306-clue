Our tests are quite similar to those of Dr. Baldwin's, as his tests were very comprehensive. However,
our tests differ in a few ways. The first difference is in the testRooms class, where our rooms and
room initials are present as opposed to the ones which were in the given test class. The next difference
is in the four door directions tests, as our doors are in different places. We accordingly modified 
the cells tested to cells which line up appropriately with our own file. The doors we tested were in
the studio, cellar, parlor, and veranda. Our number of doorways are 13 rather than 16, so we made that
change in test number of doorways. Lastly, test room initials is very different, as the initials for 
our rooms are different from the given test class, and we also tested three differnt randomly dispersed 
walkways and four dispersed closet positions.
